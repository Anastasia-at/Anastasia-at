## A few more words About Me
<div id="header" align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LT1Q7rCD5WmqJre7Wq/giphy.gif" width="300"/>
</div>

I was always good with technical disciplines: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Unfortunately, it took years for me to realize that I wish to have a job related to this subject. 
Before completing my studies at university I started to search for accounting or technical support positions and I was lucky to find one, so I became a part of a friendly Support Team. A year later I got an offer from my current employer to join their Support Team, actually, I was the first one in this team :slightly_smiling_face: I dedicated all my time to training, so I successfully completed the trial period.

I believe that my skills such as analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail, responsibility and developed communication skills helped me to reach the current stage: the management has entrusted me with the direct handling of payments and refunds, as well as in communication with suppliers and key customers on financial matters. Also, I am quite good at working as a problem-solving hub for accounting, technical support and development departments.

Now I would like to improve my technical skills further by working with various technical and visualization instruments and also with the popular languages in the world of data. For this reason, I've completed the course Data Analyst and I am ready to go for a new role as an Analyst.
