  Hi there
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>
</h2>

I am a Certified Data Analyst with a University degree in Business Administration.

I’ve been working in well-established international companies in IT and recently in Forex industry, so I perfectly understand what it means to meet demanding deadlines in a fast-paced environment, be a part of a team and to work under pressure.

As years passed, I realised that I wish to continue with Data analytics. It is so fascinating to discover uncovered trends, patterns, and correlations in large amounts of raw data and see how it makes decision-making easier!

So, I've started my studies. I learned how to analyse data with various technical and visualisation instruments and also with the most popular language in the world of data.

I’ve become a Data Analyst ⭐

I believe that a combination of my analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail together with my acquired technical skills helped me to achieve the desired position in Analytics.

I have excellent verbal and written communication skills in the English language (Advanced), my native language is Russian, and τώρα μαθαίνω Ελληνικά.
