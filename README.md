## :woman_technologist: About Me
I am a Certified Data Analyst with a University degree in Business Administration.

I‚Äôve been working in well-established international companies in IT and recently in Forex industry, so I perfectly understand what it means to meet demanding deadlines in a fast-paced environment, be a part of a team and to work under pressure.

As years passed, I realised that I wish to continue with Data analytics. It is so fascinating to discover uncovered trends, patterns, and correlations in large amounts of raw data and see how it makes decision-making easier!

So, I've started my studies ü§ì I learned how to analyse data with various technical and visualisation instruments and also with the most popular language in the world of data.

I‚Äôve become a Data Analyst ‚≠ê

I believe that a combination of my analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail together with my acquired technical skills helped me to achieve the desired position in Analytics.

I have excellent verbal and written communication skills in the English language (Advanced), my native language is Russian, and œÑœéœÅŒ± ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ±ŒØŒΩœâ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨.

## A few more words About Me
<div id="header" align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LT1Q7rCD5WmqJre7Wq/giphy.gif" width="300"/>
</div>

I was always good with technical disciplines: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. I :heart: it.

Before I graduated from university, I'd started searching for accounting or technical support positions and I was lucky to find one, so I became a part of a growing team. A year later I got an offer from my current employer to join their support team. Since it was new for me, I dedicated all my time and efforts to training, so I successfully completed the trial period. 

As a result, I started as a First-Line support with zero technical knowledge and grew to a Second-Line Tech Support specialist.

Later on, after a break I came back to the same company with a new role as an Account/Financial Manager. I believe that a combination of my soft skills and my previous experience made me an ideal candidate for that position.

As years passed, I realised that I wish to go further and continue with Big Data analytics. It is so fascinating to discover uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations in large amounts of raw data to help make data-informed decisions! During my studies I've learned how to analyse data with various technical and visualization instruments and also with the most popular languages in the world of data. So, now I am ready to go for a new role as an Analyst :star:
