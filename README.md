## A few more words About Me
<div id="header" align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LT1Q7rCD5WmqJre7Wq/giphy.gif" width="300"/>
</div>

I was always good with technical disciplines: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. I love it, so when I had a chance to switch to "numbers", I did it.

Before completing my studies at university I started to search for accounting or technical support positions and I was lucky to find one, so I became a part of a friendly Support Team. A year later I got an offer from my current employer to join their Support Team. I dedicated all my time to training, so I successfully completed the trial period. I've started as a first-line support with zero technical knowledge and grew to a Second-Line Tech Support specialist.

After a short break I came back with a new role as an Account/Financial Manager. I believe that a combination of my soft and hard skills and previous experience make me an ideal candidate for this position.

As years passed, I realised that wish to go further and continue with Big Data analytics. It is so fascinating to discover uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations in large amounts of raw data to help make data-informed decisions! During my studies I've learnned how to work with various technical and visualization instruments and also with the most popular languages in the world of data. So, now I am ready to go for a new role as an Analyst.
